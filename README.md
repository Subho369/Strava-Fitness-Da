# Strava-Fitness-Da

Hello Data Professionals! 
Just wrapped up an end-to-end data project on fitness app [Strava] usage — and here’s what I learned 👇

I analyzed user behavior from a fitness tracking app to uncover trends in:
1. Steps taken, distances walked, and calories burned
2. Activity levels by time of day and day of the week
3. Heart rate patterns and sedentary behavior

📊 From identifying the most active days and peak workout hours to spotting sedentary risks and engagement gaps — this project gave me real-world insight into how data can improve user wellness.

💡 My key contributions:

1. Cleaned and transformed raw user activity data
2. Modeled metrics like active minutes, step averages & heart rate trends
3. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize behavioral patterns

🔍 Insights like "when people move most", "weekend vs. weekday behavior", and "how activity level correlates with heart rate" can be powerful for:

1.Designing better workout recommendations
2.Encouraging healthier habits
3.Optimizing app notifications & features

✅ This project strengthened my hands-on skills in:

1. SQL for data prep & exploration
2. Power BI for storytelling with data
3. Analytical thinking to extract business-relevant insights
